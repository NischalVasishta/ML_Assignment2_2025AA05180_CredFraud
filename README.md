# ML Assignment 2 (Machine Learning) - Credit Card Fraud Detection

## a. Problem statement
Implement and compare six classification models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions (Class=1) versus legitimate transactions (Class=0). Build an interactive Streamlit app where a user can upload a CSV (test data), select a model, and view evaluation metrics and a confusion matrix / classification report.

## b. Dataset description
**Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Detection (Kaggle)  
**Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud [web:30]  
**Instances:** 284,807 transactions  
**Features:** 30 input features: `Time`, `Amount`, and `V1` to `V28` (PCA-transformed / anonymized) [web:69][web:71]  
**Target:** `Class` where 0 = legitimate and 1 = fraud [web:69]  
**Note:** The dataset is highly imbalanced (fraud cases are rare), so AUC / F1 / MCC are important along with accuracy.

## c. Models used
The following models were implemented on the same dataset:
1. Logistic Regression  
2. Decision Tree Classifier  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  
4. Naive Bayes (Gaussian)  
5. Random Forest (Ensemble)  
6. XGBoost (Ensemble)

### Metrics comparison table
Fill these numbers from your `model_results.csv` (generated by `train_models.py`).

| ML Model Name | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic Regression |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Decision Tree |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| kNN |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Naive Bayes |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Observations on model performance
Write 1–2 lines per model based on your results (especially Precision/Recall tradeoff due to imbalance).

| ML Model Name | Observation about model performance |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression |  |
| Decision Tree |  |
| kNN |  |
| Naive Bayes |  |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) |  |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) |  |

## How to run locally (BITS Virtual Lab)
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. Train models and create `model_results.csv`: `python train_models.py`  
3. Run Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`  
4. Upload a small CSV containing the same columns (including `Class`) to evaluate models.
